            The <i>"The Time"</i> game is based on 
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/the-mind"><i>"The Mind"</i></a> 
            card game where timing is key!

            "The Mind is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, 
            a team experience in which you can't exchange information, 
            yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game."

            This game is created purely for educational purposes. 
            It is not intended for profit or promotion, nor does it use or copy anyone else's ideas. 
            The main goal is to provide a fun and safe environment for learning and experimentation!!

            After <b>selecting a player</b>, each user receives <b>random numbers between 0 and 10</b>. 
            Once all players have joined, the game begins and a <b>5 - seconds countdown</b> starts.
            The main goal of the game is for players to <b>synchronize their card plays</b> 
            (in this case - numbers) without communicating. 
            Each player must play their card (the numbers they were assigned in the start of the game) 
            in ascending order as the countdown progresses. 
            If a player plays their card (number) too early or too late, the game ends. 
            If all players successfully coordinate their numbers, the game is won.
